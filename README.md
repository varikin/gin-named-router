# Gin Named Router

Adds the ability to name routes in [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/).

See [GoDocs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/varikin/gin-named-router?tab=doc) for the documentation.
Hopefully, the example is enough.
If not, please let me know.

## Should I use this?

NO!

This is incomplete.
It does not yet support groups in Gin which is the biggest missing feature gap.
